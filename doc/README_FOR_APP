=== How-to: port AmbGest2 DB to AmbGest3

For a yet-to-be-created production DB, do this:

- rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=production
- There's no need to run the migrations, since the schema is already
  complete.
- The above will also add the seed data from db/seeds.rb,
  which contains the default app_parameter and user data (which is not
  included in the git archive).
- Do a mysql dump of the AmbGest2 DB, selecting just these entity tables:
  appointments, patients, receipts, schedules, le_titles, le_cities.
- Upload the dump into AmbGest3 production DB. That's all.



=== How-to: make Netzke and ExtJS 4 work flawlessly with Rails 3 & its assets pipeline

Simply put, they don't. Don't waste time trying to fix it or cache it in
some other manner.

The dynamic loading of ExtJS classes does not work with the assets pipeline,
so the only way to optimize it, it's to keep the Netzke components precompiled
inside the assets pipeline and the ExtJS library itself out of it, using the
dedicated public/extjs subfolder.

Netzke 0.7.7 expects precisely:
- all fam-fam icons to be under public/images/icons
- ExtJS library 4.1.1 to be under public/extjs

...Otherwise most icons will be missing from the UI and/or some ExtJS classes
will be unloadable.
